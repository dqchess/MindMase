Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset

Risk value = Exploitability * Prevalence * Detectability * Impacts
1) Requirement Analysis
- integration security elements in the requirements
- add time and budget for security in the phases.
Plan security testing in the testing phase
2) Design
- security per design
3) Implementation
- secure coding, best practice, internal testing
4) Testing & Integration
- pentesting, application security, database security, architecture review,
stress test, crash tests
5) Evolution
- infrastructure testing, updates (software/hardware),
regular pentesting
- Risk assessment updates


DAST:
Dynamic Application Security Testing
process of testing a software product in an operating state
SAST:
Static Application Security Testing
looking at the source code and theorizing about security vulnerabilities or spotting
design and construction flaws with potential for vulnerability

A test plan must include following information's
1) Test planning
2) Test Design
3) Test Execution
4) Evaluation of the results
5) Improvement proposal
Security testing is included in the test plan

Vulnerability testing (scans) 
Penetration testing 
Code audit 
Documentation audit
Process audit 
Disaster recovery testing
